- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @deadxPC
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in *low-level programming*, such as *C*, *Vlang* and *Nim*
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about *OS development* trying to build my own one
        called *BOS*, or *Basic Operating System*, a minimal, secure, standalone
        OS for reasonably high-end single board computers, like the *BeagleBone Black*;
        ***DOT NOT THINK I KNOW WHAT I AM DOING TO THE EXTENT THAT LINUS TORVALDS DID***
- ðŸ“« How to reach me:
        I would be delighted to know about your projects, email me at **cummingthom@icloud.com**
        (I need something other than mail from [websites I use] in my email right now!)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I also love making *music*, learning about *science*, *philosophy*, *math*,
        please don't hesitate to chat with me about that stuff too!
